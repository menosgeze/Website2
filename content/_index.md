# GEZE

Hi all! I will be the content of this website. I will mainly post two things:
![myself](./myself.jpg)
{{< columns >}}


## 1. Summaries 
I will either list links to 
__summaries__ of books-chapters, classes, topics, etc
that I am interested about. In part, I am using this website as a self-organization tool. 

<--->
## 2. Tutorials.
I will post my 'redo' of great __tutorials__ and __cheat sheets__ (with the credits through links to the original authors.)
{{< /columns >}}

## Who am I?
I am a Salvadorean who went from being a _Parking Attendant_ in Universal Studios Hollywood,
to a _Mathematics Ph.D._ from the University of Washington, Seattle in only 12 years... maybe not so great for 
so many more successful people, but I am content with who I am. I am an Perico (Externado de San Jose), Bruin (UCLA), Matador (CSUN), and Husky (UW) looking to transition into a Data scientist position.
